# Quick Start: Subscription-Appointment Connection

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

Your subscription-appointment connection system is now set up. Here's how to test it:

### **Step 1: Test Database Functions**
Run these queries in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if you have active subscriptions
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions WHERE status IN ('active', 'trialing');

-- Test the subscription status view
SELECT * FROM public.user_subscription_status LIMIT 5;
```

### **Step 2: Test the App**
1. **Open your app** and go to the Book screen
2. **Look for the footer** - it should now show "Cuts remaining: X"
3. **Try booking an appointment**:
   - If you have cuts → should work normally
   - If no cuts → button disabled, shows "No Cuts Remaining"

### **Step 3: Test Cancellation**
1. **Book an appointment** (if you have cuts)
2. **Cancel it** from the Appointments screen
3. **Check if cuts are restored** (if ≥7 days left in billing period)

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **Database:**
- ✅ New functions to check remaining cuts
- ✅ Automatic validation prevents overbooking
- ✅ Smart cut restoration on cancellation

### **App:**
- ✅ Shows remaining cuts in booking screen
- ✅ Prevents booking when no cuts available
- ✅ Better error messages with upgrade suggestions
- ✅ Real-time cut tracking

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ Clear feedback about cut availability
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Prevents confusion about booking limits

## 🐛 **If Something's Wrong**

1. **Check the console** for any errors
2. **Verify database functions** were created successfully
3. **Check your subscription status** in the database
4. **Look at the test plan** in `SUBSCRIPTION_APPOINTMENT_TEST_PLAN.md`

## 📱 **Ready to Go!**

Your subscription-appointment system is now connected! Users with 1 cut/month can only book 1 appointment at a time, and the system will guide them appropriately when they need to upgrade or cancel existing appointments.

**Happy testing!** 🎉
