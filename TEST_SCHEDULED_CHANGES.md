# Testing Scheduled Changes Feature

## 🎯 **What We've Fixed**

The issue was that you were using **Stripe's Customer Portal** for plan changes, which does **immediate changes** instead of scheduled changes. I've now integrated the scheduled changes feature into your app's UI.

## 🆕 **New Features Added**

### 1. **PlanChangeModal Component**
- Beautiful modal for selecting new plans
- **Automatic detection** of upgrades vs downgrades
- **Scheduled downgrades** for lower-tier plans
- **Immediate upgrades** for higher-tier plans

### 2. **Updated ManageSubscriptionScreen**
- **"Change Plan" button** now opens the new modal
- **"Billing Portal" button** for other billing needs (invoices, payment methods, etc.)
- **Integrated scheduled changes** display

## 🧪 **How to Test the Scheduled Changes**

### **Step 1: Upgrade to a Higher Plan**
1. Go to **Manage Subscription** screen
2. Tap **"Change Plan"**
3. Select **Premium** or **VIP** plan
4. Complete the upgrade (this will be immediate)

### **Step 2: Schedule a Downgrade**
1. After upgrading, go back to **Manage Subscription**
2. Tap **"Change Plan"** again
3. Select **Basic** plan (lower tier)
4. **You should see**: "Downgrade Scheduled" message
5. **You should see**: Scheduled change card showing when the downgrade will take effect

### **Step 3: Verify the Scheduled Change**
1. **Check the debug card** - it should show:
   - Current plan: Premium/VIP
   - Scheduled plan: Basic
   - Scheduled effective date: End of current billing period
2. **Check the scheduled change card** - it should display the downgrade info
3. **Restart the app** - the scheduled change should persist

### **Step 4: Test Canceling the Scheduled Change**
1. On the scheduled change card, tap **"Cancel Change"**
2. Confirm the cancellation
3. The scheduled change card should disappear
4. You should remain on your current plan

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Downgrades show "Downgrade Scheduled" message
- Scheduled change card appears after downgrade
- Current plan stays the same until period ends
- Scheduled change persists after app restart
- Can cancel scheduled changes

### **❌ Failure Indicators:**
- Downgrades happen immediately
- No scheduled change card appears
- Plan changes right away
- Scheduled changes don't persist after restart

## 🐛 **Debugging**

If it's not working:

1. **Check the debug card** - it shows all the data being loaded
2. **Check console logs** - look for any errors
3. **Verify Edge Functions** are deployed:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy stripe-schedule-downgrade
   supabase functions deploy stripe-cancel-schedule
   supabase functions deploy stripe-get-schedule
   ```
4. **Check Stripe Dashboard** - look for subscription schedules

## 📱 **Expected User Experience**

### **For Downgrades:**
1. User selects lower-tier plan
2. App shows "Downgrade Scheduled" message
3. User keeps current plan benefits
4. Scheduled change card shows when change will take effect
5. At period end: Plan automatically changes

### **For Upgrades:**
1. User selects higher-tier plan
2. App redirects to Stripe Checkout
3. User completes payment
4. Plan changes immediately
5. User gets new benefits right away

## 🎉 **The Result**

Now when you downgrade from VIP to Basic:
- ✅ **No immediate charge**
- ✅ **Keep VIP benefits** until period ends
- ✅ **Clear communication** about when change takes effect
- ✅ **Option to cancel** if you change your mind
- ✅ **Professional billing experience**

Try it out and let me know if you see the scheduled changes working as expected!
