## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Review Photos Storage Bucket

Run the SQL script to create the storage bucket and policies:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i setup-review-storage.sql
```

Or manually execute:

```sql
-- Create review-photos storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('review-photos', 'review-photos', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Set up RLS policies for review-photos bucket
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view review photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'review-photos');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload review photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'review-photos' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own review photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'review-photos' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own review photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'review-photos' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

### 2. Verify Database Schema

Ensure your `appointments` table has the review columns:

```sql
-- Check if review columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'appointments' 
AND column_name IN ('rating', 'review_text', 'review_photo_url');
```

If missing, add them:

```sql
ALTER TABLE appointments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS review_text TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS review_photo_url TEXT;
```

### 3. Test the Review Flow

1. **Book an appointment** through the app
2. **Go to Appointments tab** and find your appointment
3. **Click "Review"** on a past appointment
4. **Submit a review** with:
   - Star rating (required)
   - Text feedback (optional)
   - Photo upload (optional)
5. **Navigate to barber profile** to see your review displayed

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

### Test Data

Create test appointments and reviews:

UPDATE appointments 
SET 
  rating = 5,
  review_text = 'Amazing haircut! Highly recommend.',
  review_photo_url = 'https://example.com/photo.jpg',
  status = 'completed'
WHERE id = 'your-appointment-id';
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No reviews yet" showing**: Check if barber has reviews in database
2. **Photo upload fails**: Verify storage bucket exists and RLS policies are correct
3. **Review not appearing**: Check appointment status is 'completed'
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure user is authenticated and has proper RLS access

### Debug Steps

1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify storage bucket exists: `SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'review-photos'`
3. Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'appointments'`
4. Test review submission in Supabase dashboard
