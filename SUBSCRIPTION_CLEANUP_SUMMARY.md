# Subscription System Cleanup Summary

## 🎯 **What We've Accomplished**

### **1. Updated ProfileScreen to Use New Cut Tracking System**
- ✅ **Replaced old calculation**: `BillingService.calculateCutsRemaining()` → `CutTrackingService.getCutStatus()`
- ✅ **Accurate cut display**: Now shows cuts remaining that accounts for upcoming appointments
- ✅ **Real subscription data**: Uses actual Stripe subscription information
- ✅ **Added TODO comments**: For future payment method integration

### **2. Removed Mock Data Usage**
- ✅ **AppContext**: Removed hardcoded `credits: 4` → `credits: 0` (now managed by subscription system)
- ✅ **App.tsx**: Updated to load real services from database with fallback to mock services
- ✅ **BookScreen**: Now uses services from AppContext instead of importing mock services directly
- ✅ **ServiceService**: Created new service to manage real services from database

### **3. Created Real Service Management**
- ✅ **ServiceService.ts**: New service class for database operations
- ✅ **Database integration**: Services now loaded from `services` table
- ✅ **Fallback system**: Uses mock services if no real services exist in database
- ✅ **Sample data script**: `add-sample-services.sql` to populate services table

### **4. Enhanced Cut Tracking Consistency**
- ✅ **Centralized service**: `CutTrackingService` used across all screens
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: ProfileScreen and BookScreen both use same calculation
- ✅ **Accurate display**: Shows cuts remaining including upcoming appointments
- ✅ **Better UX**: Consistent cut information across the entire app
