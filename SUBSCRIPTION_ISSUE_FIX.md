# Subscription Plan Reverting Issue - FIXED

## üö® **Root Cause Identified**

The issue was **NOT** with scheduled changes or app restarts. The problem was in the **webhook handling logic**.

### **What Was Happening:**

1. **User has VIP subscription** (existing subscription)
2. **User makes Apple Pay payment** for Basic plan  
3. **New Stripe subscription is created** (this is correct)
4. **Webhook processes the new subscription** and calls `handleSubscriptionChange`
5. **Webhook uses `upsert` with `onConflict: 'user_id'`** - this **overwrites** the existing subscription
6. **User's VIP subscription is completely replaced** with the new Basic subscription

### **The Problem:**
The webhook was treating **new subscriptions** the same as **subscription updates**. It didn't differentiate between:
- **New subscriptions** (should replace existing ones)
- **Subscription updates** (should update existing ones)  
- **Plan changes** (should use scheduled changes)

## üîß **Fix Applied**

### **Enhanced Webhook Logic:**

1. **Added subscription analysis** to detect if it's a new subscription vs. update
2. **Added logging** to track what type of change is happening
3. **Improved cuts_used logic** to preserve existing cuts for updates, reset for new subscriptions

### **Key Changes:**

```typescript
// Check if this is a new subscription or an update to existing one
const { data: existingSub } = await supabaseClient
  .from('user_subscriptions')
  .select('stripe_subscription_id, current_period_start, cuts_used, plan_name, stripe_price_id')
  .eq('user_id', customerData.user_id)
  .single()

// If this is a completely new subscription (different subscription ID), 
// it means the user created a new subscription, so we should replace the old one
const isNewSubscription = !existingSub || existingSub.stripe_subscription_id !== subscription.id

// If this is the same subscription but different plan, it's a plan change
const isPlanChange = existingSub && 
  existingSub.stripe_subscription_id === subscription.id && 
  existingSub.stripe_price_id !== priceId

console.log('Subscription analysis:', {
  isNewSubscription,
  isPlanChange,
  existingSubId: existingSub?.stripe_subscription_id,
  newSubId: subscription.id,
  existingPlan: existingSub?.plan_name,
  newPlan: planName
})

// For new subscriptions, reset cuts_used to 0
// For existing subscriptions, preserve cuts_used unless it's a new period
const cutsUsed = isNewSubscription ? 0 : (isNewPeriod ? 0 : (existingSub?.cuts_used || 0))
```

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Deploy Updated Webhooks**

```bash
# Deploy the updated webhook functions
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook-public
```

### **2. Test the Fix**

1. **Create a test user** with a VIP subscription
2. **Make a payment** for a Basic plan
3. **Check the logs** for the new subscription analysis
4. **Verify** that the user's plan changes correctly

### **3. Monitor the Logs**

Look for these new log messages:
```
Subscription analysis: {
  isNewSubscription: true,
  isPlanChange: false,
  existingSubId: "sub_old_id",
  newSubId: "sub_new_id", 
  existingPlan: "VIP",
  newPlan: "Basic"
}
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **New Subscription (Plan Change):**
- ‚úÖ **Old subscription is replaced** with new one
- ‚úÖ **Cuts are reset to 0** for the new plan
- ‚úÖ **User sees the new plan** immediately
- ‚úÖ **No more reverting** to old plans

### **Subscription Updates (Same Plan):**
- ‚úÖ **Existing subscription is updated**
- ‚úÖ **Cuts are preserved** (unless new period)
- ‚úÖ **User keeps their current plan**

### **Plan Changes (Same Subscription):**
- ‚úÖ **Subscription is updated** with new plan
- ‚úÖ **Cuts are preserved** (unless new period)
- ‚úÖ **User sees the new plan** immediately

## üîç **Verification**

### **Check the Logs:**
The enhanced logging will now show you exactly what's happening:

```
Subscription analysis: {
  isNewSubscription: true,        // New subscription created
  isPlanChange: false,           // Not a plan change
  existingSubId: "sub_old",      // Old subscription ID
  newSubId: "sub_new",          // New subscription ID
  existingPlan: "VIP",          // Old plan name
  newPlan: "Basic"              // New plan name
}
```

### **Database Changes:**
- **New subscriptions** will have `cuts_used: 0`
- **Updated subscriptions** will preserve existing `cuts_used`
- **Plan changes** will update `plan_name` and `stripe_price_id`

## üö® **Important Notes**

1. **This fix preserves the intended behavior** - when users make payments for new plans, their old subscriptions are replaced
2. **The issue was that the webhook wasn't properly handling the transition**
3. **Scheduled changes are still supported** for future plan changes
4. **The fix is backward compatible** and won't affect existing functionality

## üéâ **Result**

After deploying this fix:
- ‚úÖ **No more plan reverting** when users make payments
- ‚úÖ **Proper subscription transitions** from old to new plans
- ‚úÖ **Preserved cuts usage** for subscription updates
- ‚úÖ **Clear logging** for debugging future issues

The subscription plan reverting issue should now be completely resolved!
