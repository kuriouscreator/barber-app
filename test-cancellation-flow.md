# Testing Appointment Cancellation Flow

## 🎯 **What Should Happen When an Appointment is Canceled:**

### **1. Immediate UI Updates:**
- ✅ **Appointment disappears** from HomeScreen
- ✅ **Appointment disappears** from AppointmentsScreen
- ✅ **Appointment status** changes to 'cancelled' in database
- ✅ **User credits** are restored (if applicable)

### **2. Availability System Updates:**
- ✅ **Time slot becomes available** for other customers
- ✅ **BookScreen refreshes** available times when focused
- ✅ **No double bookings** possible after cancellation

### **3. Database Changes:**
- ✅ **Appointment status** = 'cancelled'
- ✅ **Time slot** is no longer blocked
- ✅ **Other customers** can book the same time

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios:**

### **Test 1: Cancel from HomeScreen**
1. **Book an appointment** for a specific time
2. **Go to HomeScreen** - should show the appointment
3. **Click "Cancel"** on the appointment
4. **Confirm cancellation** - appointment should disappear
5. **Go to BookScreen** - the time slot should be available again

### **Test 2: Cancel from AppointmentsScreen**
1. **Book an appointment** for a specific time
2. **Go to Appointments tab** - should show the appointment
3. **Click "Cancel"** on the appointment
4. **Confirm cancellation** - appointment should disappear
5. **Go to BookScreen** - the time slot should be available again

### **Test 3: Multiple Users Booking Same Time**
1. **User A books** appointment for 2:00 PM
2. **User B tries to book** 2:00 PM - should be unavailable
3. **User A cancels** the 2:00 PM appointment
4. **User B tries to book** 2:00 PM - should now be available

### **Test 4: Service Duration Blocking**
1. **Book a 60-minute service** (e.g., Premium Package) at 2:00 PM
2. **Check that 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM** are both blocked
3. **Cancel the appointment**
4. **Check that both 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM** are now available

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ **No "time slot no longer available" errors**
- ✅ **Appointments disappear immediately** from UI
- ✅ **Time slots become available** after cancellation
- ✅ **No double bookings** occur

### **Error Indicators:**
- ❌ **Appointment still shows** after cancellation
